I decided to just think and make bullets of everything that came to my mind for ~10 minutes.</p>\n<div class=\"subscription-widget-wrap-editor\" data-attrs='{\"url\":\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/subscribe?\",\"text\":\"Subscribe\",\"language\":\"en\"}' data-component-name=\"SubscribeWidgetToDOM\"><div class=\"subscription-widget show-subscribe\">\n<div class=\"preamble\"><p class=\"cta-caption\">Thanks for reading Jacob's Substack! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work.</p></div>\n<div class=\"fake-input-wrapper\">\n<div class=\"fake-input\"></div>\n<div class=\"fake-button\"></div>\n</div>\n</div></div>\n<p>List of my initial thoughts: </p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>I am relieved to finally have a ‘safety net’ for the rest of my life.</p></li>\n<li><p>School (and life) goes by quick, take a moment to smell the roses.</p></li>\n<li><p>Getting a degree is difficult, but extremely simple.</p></li>\n<li><p>I can now fully focus on what’s next in my life.</p></li>\n<li><p>I’m so grateful I had a job lined up (praise the Lord).</p></li>\n<li><p>It doesn’t truly feel done until you get all of your grades back.</p></li>\n<li><p>Finally, I have more time to code and build things that interest me.</p></li>\n<li><p>I can be ‘still’ for a moment and not be stressed about my productivity.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Overall, my Auburn degree provided me a great way to find direction in my life. The co-op/internships I completed and the people I met have greatly influenced how I approach problems and plan for my future. I would have figured out a direction without college, but college provides guardrails that clearly steer you for a couple of years. Now the guardrails are off and I am excited to use what I’ve learned to make my own path.</p>\n<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>\n<p>I’ll try to keep these lessons high level! There a plenty of other lessons I’ve learned as well but I’m not going to write them all here, the post would be too long.</p>\n<h4>Everything can be self taught without a degree.</h4>\n<p>With resources like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"https://medium.com/\">Medium</a>, and <a href=\"https://chatgpt.com/\">ChatGPT</a>, you can quickly research and deeply learn any topic you have an interest in at a bachelor’s degree level. A degree does offer opportunities for you to network which is great, but the resources I mentioned often provide more up to date and easier to understand information. The structure and legitimacy provided by school is beneficial, but be honest with yourself in deciding if this is needed for your situation.</p>\n<h4>You can make time for anything you truly value.</h4>\n<p>Life gets busy with school and it can be easy to say you ‘only have time for school’ when parts of your day are also filled with TV, video games, or scrolling. Simply spending 30 minutes a day on something outside of school has compounding effects over 4 years! Tiny things like spending time on my resume, doing <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">LeetCode</a>, and making projects has paid dividends to me and is the reason I am in Atlanta today. Many of you likely had a busier schedule than me, especially if you worked while in school, I write this to challenge you to consistently work on something that your future self will thank you for, even if its just a little bit per week or day.</p>\n<h4>Your environment changes everything.</h4>\n<p>Most of my thoughts related to this lesson are detailed in my <a href=\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/p/your-environment-changes-everything\">previous post</a>. But at a high level, surrounding yourself with other motivated people greatly impacts the opportunities you have and your approach to challenges. A separate point that I want to make is that your support net also makes a huge difference. The support from my parents and wife allowed me to focus more on school and I am super grateful to them, <strong>THANK YOU</strong>! They have allowed me to make my career my full focus right now, without them this would have been much more difficult.</p>\n<h4>Everyone has different motivations for getting a degree.</h4>\n<p>In college, people either had goals that would be greatly facilitated by a degree, had goals that did not need a degree, or were still figuring out what their goals were. If you are unsure of your goals or a degree is not needed, please do not treat college as a 4 year break, it’s <strong>WAY TOO EXPENSIVE</strong> for that! Actively thinking about this when working with others would have saved me from a lot of frustration. You can’t expect group members to put in extra effort for assignments when their goals don’t require that extra effort. Try to understand the situation others are working though!</p>\n<h4>Start now before life smacks you in the face.</h4>\n<p>If you want to get a job that is directly related to your degree, you need your career to be a primary focus throughout your 4 years at college. Before COVID and the AI boom, new grads in 2019 had a 60% employment rate in fields related to their degree<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" href=\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/#footnote-1\" target=\"_self\">1</a>. Now that number for new grads is just 30% in 2025<a class=\"footnote-anchor\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteAnchorToDOM\" href=\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/#footnote-2\" target=\"_self\">2</a>. I mention this to motivate you, be in that 30% and <strong>LOCK IN</strong> before life smacks you in the face after you walk the stage. College no longer provides a guaranteed job or high salary. However, college does provide all the resources and experiences needed to land that job and salary, <strong>YOU</strong> just have to be the one that puts in the extra work.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next</h2>\n<p>During my ~1 month break I am going to get back into a consistent schedule to prepare for both my SWE job at <a href=\"https://www.att.com/\">AT&amp;T</a> and master’s degree at <a href=\"https://www.gatech.edu/\">Georgia Tech</a>. Before that I need to finish moving in. 😅</p>\n<p>My top priorities for the break are as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Structure my day so that transitioning into full time work is simple.</p></li>\n<li><p>Build cool projects and just enjoy coding during the break.</p></li>\n<li><p>Get back into the gym and start hitting new PRs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Determine my goals and approach for content creation.</p></li>\n<li><p>RELAX! Just being ‘still’ for a while and hanging out with my wife and cats.</p></li>\n<li><p>Explore more of Atlanta and find some nice local restaurants.</p></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks for reading this far! I look forward to writing posts about the projects I have been building during this break so stay tuned.</p>\n<h2>Works Cited</h2>\n<div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\">\n<a href=\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/#footnote-anchor-1\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">1</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Cengage. <a href=\"https://blog.cengage.com/student-opportunity-insights-rose-colored-glasses-for-near-recent-grads/\">Student Opportunity Insights: Rose-Colored Glasses for Near and Recent Grads</a>. <em>The Cengage Blog</em>, July 12, 2019.</p></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"footnote\" data-component-name=\"FootnoteToDOM\">\n<a href=\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/#footnote-anchor-2\" class=\"footnote-number\" contenteditable=\"false\" target=\"_self\">2</a><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Cengage Group. <a href=\"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250909292629/en/Cengage-Groups-2025-Employability-Report-Reveals-Growing-Gap-Between-Education-and-Employment\">Cengage Group’s 2025 Employability Report Reveals Growing Gap Between Education and Employment</a>. <em>Business Wire</em>, Sept. 9, 2025.</p></div>\n</div>\n","enclosure":{"link":"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!hviV!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/a15f7f66-9fd3-4243-9a7b-4e18f0232bbb_3024x3344.jpeg","type":"image/jpeg"},"categories":[]},{"title":"Your Environment Changes EVERYTHING","pubDate":"2025-11-18 22:20:22","link":"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/p/your-environment-changes-everything","guid":"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/p/your-environment-changes-everything","author":"Jacob Murrah","thumbnail":"","description":"Because how can you know what you've never seen or experienced?","content":"\n<p>Throughout my life I have been a part of many different groups and had the pleasure of hearing the experiences of people from different backgrounds.

After school I would practice football with my neighborhood friends and when I wasn’t outside I was glued to the TV watching the <a href=\"https://www.nfl.com/network\">NFL Network</a>. Hearing the stories of past NFL players really motivated me and gave me the belief that <strong>anything is possible, no matter your background</strong>.</p>\n<p>In middle school my passion transitioned to FPS video games, specifically <a href=\"https://www.counter-strike.net/\">CS:GO</a> and eventually <a href=\"https://www.fortnite.com/?lang=en-US\">Fortnite</a> in high school. I’ve logged over 10,000+ hours into FPS games and reached a <a href=\"https://fortnitetracker.com/profile/kbm/murr%CE%B1h/events?region=GLOBAL\">semi-professional level</a> in Fortnite. The friends I met in these games were all highly motivated in the same way I was. Everyone I interacted with believed they could play at a professional level and devoted their time to becoming the best.</p>\n<p>I give this background to convey that my experiences before college led me to:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Believe that I could <strong>learn and become excellent at </strong><em><strong>ANYTHING</strong></em><strong> I pursued</strong>.</p></li>\n<li><p>Primarily interact with people who were <em>highly driven</em>. </p></li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Getting lucky</h2>\n<p>Going into college (2021) I had quit playing FPS games seriously and for the first time in my life I did not have something I was going ‘all in’ on. I went to the gym and played on my school’s <a href=\"https://playvalorant.com/en-us/\">Valorant</a> team but I was essentially coasting for the first 2 years of college. After my sophomore year I landed a Software Engineer Co-op at <a href=\"https://www.adtran.com/en\">Adtran</a> which guaranteed 3 internship rotations with them. </p>\n<blockquote><p>I felt extremely <em>lucky</em> to land the Adtran role.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I had only prepared for 2 weeks and did not know how to code at all. I was only able to get an interview because Auburn let me sign up for the interview regardless of what my resume looked like. </p>\n<p><strong>NOTE: Use your college’s career resources!</strong></p>\n<h2>Locking in (again)</h2>\n<p>After landing my co-op I had decided to go ‘all in’ again, but this time on my career. I began doing <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">LeetCode</a>, understanding what it meant to be a good software engineer, and learning the game that is the software engineering job search. Basically my time at Adtran allowed me to put my head down and learn from the talented individuals around me. I was away from Auburn for <em><strong>over a year </strong></em>(training in the ‘mountains’)!</p>\n<p>There were two types of interns I noticed at Adtran.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Those who were perfectly happy to spend the rest of their career at Adtran.</p></li>\n<li><p>Those who were shooting for the huge companies (FAANG+).</p></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a

software engineering and the confidence needed to try. Upon returning to Auburn to finish the first semester of my senior year, I began noticing a sentiment of pessimism amongst students in relation to the computer science job market. </p>\n<blockquote><p>Finding a new grad job was finally on the mind of ALL STUDENTS, including those with no internships or minimal experience.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Auburn University is NOT a top rated computer science school. At the time of writing we are ranked 88th on the <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-science-schools/computer-science-rankings\">U.S. News Best Graduate Computer Science Schools</a> ranking. This isn’t terrible but in a computer science market as competitive as today, Auburn students need to be locked in to stand a chance.</p>\n<p>I see senior students sending out hundreds of applications and getting no responses and some students who have given up all together. For many students this is their first time in their lives facing mass rejection. I’ve noticed highly capable students begin to view themselves in an extremely negative light.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Students feel like they have <em>no control</em> of the situation they are in.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In some sense this is true, their lack of experience will make it <em>very difficult</em> to find a job in the short term. But I believe that <strong>ANYONE </strong>can get to a world class level if they give it their all. The people that start now and put in years of work can make it. In that sense they <strong>DO HAVE CONTROL</strong> of their future. However, in an environment where this pessimism is prevalent, why would they believe anything else is possible?</p>\n<h2>The other side</h2>\n<p>After finishing the first semester of my senior year I spent the summer in Atlanta, GA to complete my first internship after my co-op. I managed to land <a href=\"https://www.att.com/\">AT&amp;T</a> which I was ecstatic for.</p>\n<blockquote><p>This was a life and career changing opportunity for me due to the <em>environment</em>.</p></blockquote>\n<p>My first day on AT&amp;T campus shocked me because it was a complete 180 to the Auburn environment I had just come from. Most of the interns went to top rated computer science schools and for many this was their first internship. These schools included Georgia Tech, UIUC, Washington, Brown, UCLA, and NYU among others. People casually talked about their goals, future internships they had lined up, and crazy companies their friends were at.</p>\n<blockquote><p>No one doubted that they would be successful.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The people I met at AT&amp;T pursued their goals and if they had a problem they found a way to fix it. Failure as it was defined at Auburn wasn’t even part of the equation here. The goal wasn’t to get a job, it was to break into big tech or quant before they graduated.</p>\n<div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-img\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_!qZMi!,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg\" data-component-name=\"Image2ToDOM\"><div class=\"image2-inset\">\n<picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/%24s_!qZMi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg\" width=\"3882\" height=\"1627\" data-attrs='{\"src\":\"https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg\",\"srcNoWatermark\":null,\"fullscreen\":null,\"imageSize\":null,\"height\":1627,\"width\":3882,\"resizeWidth\":null,\"bytes\":1557749,\"alt\":null,\"title\":null,\"type\":\"image/jpeg\",\"href\":null,\"belowTheFold\":true,\"topImage\":false,\"internalRedirect\":\"https://jacobmurrah.substack.com/i/179266405?img=https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F1bb6c23e-7f7a-4397-8d03-a75480bc586c_4032x3024.jpeg\",\"isProcessing\":false,\"align\":null,\"offset\":false}' class=\"sizing-normal\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!qZMi!,w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F34ac2c7e-bc5b-46e6-9ae5-708ddee7992f_3882x1627.jpeg 1456w\" sizes=\"100vw\" loading=\"lazy\"></source></picture><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><div class=\"pencraft pc-display-flex pc-gap-8 pc-reset\">\n<button tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container restack-image\"><svg role=\"img\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 20 20\" fill=\"none\" stroke-width=\"1.5\" stroke=\"var(--color-fg-primary)\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><g><title></title>\n<path d=\"M2.53001 7.81595C3.49179 4.73911 6.43281 2.5 9.91173 2.5C13.1684 2.5 15.9537 4.46214 17.0852 7.23684L17.6179 8.67647M17.6179 8.67647L18.5002 4.26471M17.6179 8.67647L13.6473 6.91176M17.4995 12.1841C16.5378 15.2609 13.5967 17.5 10.1178 17.5C6.86118 17.5 4.07589 15.5379 2.94432 12.7632L2.41165 11.3235M2.41165 11.3235L1.5293 15.7353M2.41165 11.3235L6.38224 13.0882\"></path></g></svg></button><button tabindex=\"0\" type=\"button\" class=\"pencraft pc-reset pencraft icon-container view-image\"><svg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" width=\"20\" height=\"20\" viewbox=\"0 0 24 24\" fill=\"none\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-width=\"2\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 lucide-maximize-2\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></button>\n</div></div>\n</div></a><figcaption class=\"image-caption\">AT&amp;T Campus -

Instead of complaining about the job market they played the game and were winning.</p>\n<p>Don’t get me wrong, going to these highly rated schools makes things a lot easier. Many interns had family in big tech and grew up in a culture of working hard. Their environment played a <strong>HUGE ROLE</strong>. If they have a question on how to do something, there’s likely someone one call away who knows the answer. However, this only makes things easier, it <em>does not determine</em> who will be successful.</p>\n<p>No matter your background, you still have to work hard.</p>\n<h2>Why not you?</h2>\n<p>The message I want to leave you with is that the people I met at AT&amp;T were NOT light years ahead of the people I’ve met at Auburn or Adtran in terms of intelligence or skill. The differentiating factor was the environment around them and their confidence.</p>\n<p>I’ve noticed that in today’s age there are a lot of people who have given up before even trying to go all in. For the people who are giving it their all, it just makes it easier for them to stand out and surpass those who are too afraid to try.</p>\n<blockquote><p>With the internet you can learn literally anything needed to break into any company in the world.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I am telling anyone reading this that you <strong>ARE CAPABLE</strong> and in order succeed you <strong>MUST BELIEVE</strong> even when you have no proof to back it up. That’s what it takes to start! Over time you begin to build your own proof to show yourself. However, if you are waiting for proof to even start, you’ll just be waiting forever.</p>\n<p>As you develop your skills, you inevitably meet people going through similar trials as you. By <em>leveling up</em> you start to meet people who are where you want to be. Your environment starts to change and things just become easier as the ‘snowball’ starts to roll. So join the club you want to join, go to the event you think is interesting, do everything in your power to surround yourself with people who view success as the only option.</p>\n<div
